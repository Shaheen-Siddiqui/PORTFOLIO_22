       when I was making this project, I did not know all the things, I have learned by study <br>
        continuously, I wanted to become a web developer from the very beginning. <br>
        That's why I was constantly learning something or the other. <br>

        There were a lot of such youtubers who do very good explanation  <br>
        Most of the time I used html,css in theses projects ..I love it <br>
        because it was easy, I could learn easily. <br>
        I really enjoyed doing JavaScript projects. My projects may have added functionality. <br>
        I started learning JavaScript continuously with the help of google search injan now I am preparing myself to <br>
        make a website. <br>
        I got to learn a lot,,
        while making projects, I got theoretical theoretical and logical knowledge <br>
        Which was very helpful for me. <br>
        I came to host the website.. 
        Now I can show my work to public by hosting my website <br>
        This was a continuous learning phrase for me in which I learned a lot.
